# done CRs, oldest first
- Split it into the files style.css, whisper-page.html, js.file
- NEVER read the API key from the input field, but instead from the cookie.
- after the API key was saved, delete it from the input field
- make buttons have different colors make them have just about 1/4 of the current gap
- let me download the files
- structured across three files: style.css, whisper-page.html, and script.js. The setup will include:
- Saving an API key from a cookie, not an input field.
- Clearing the API key from the input field after it's saved.
- Styling buttons with different colors and reducing the gap between them
- I want COMPLETE files, not just a basic structure.

# new CRs
The following are my change requirements, which I want you to implement. Do NOT implement them yet, but instead specify the passages which are not yet in great detail in great detail:
- after the key was saved, hide the key input field and the save button and show a "Delete API key" button as the last button.
- while a recordings is taken indicate that by a spinner.
